a simple grade portal app

A capstone project I'm commisioned to create last 2019
It is created using html, css, native js and jquery for front-end, php for back-end and phpmyadmin for its data storing(mariaDB)

The template for sql is saved in this folder too but no real record from any personel nor student of the school
It was never uploaded in the internet hence, I can only show you this to prove I really did this project
